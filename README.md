## CS150 Assignment 4

Credit Card Processing

**Date assigned:** Wednesday, October 6, 2021

**Program due:** Monday, October 18, 2021, \[9:15AM Sect 02; 1:00PM Sect
01\]

**Points**: 35

**Goals:**

1.  Read and process data from a file

2.  Write C++ code with nested logic

3.  Error check your program using multiple test files

Most people pay a large portion of their bills with a credit card.
Unfortunately, many maintain a balance with a large interest rate. You
are to write a C++ program that processes the credit card account
activity for zero or more individuals. The account activity will be
maintained in a data file called **creditcard.txt** with the following
format.

<pre>
AccountNumber Date Transaction BeginningBalance
AccountNumber Date TransactionLocation TransactionAmount
AccountNumber Date TransactionLocation TransactionAmount
NewAccountNumber Date Transaction BeginningBalance
NewAccountNumber Date TransactionLocation TransactionAmount
...
00000 00/00/00 End 0.0
</pre>

Here is a sample data file:

<pre>
12345 10/01/14 Balance 1500.00
12345 10/01/14 McDonalds 10.75
12345 10/05/14 Walmart 50.65
54321 10/01/14 Balance 16.75
54321 10/06/14 McMenamins 23.00
54321 10/07/14 Payment -25.00
54321 10/10/14 Comcast 130.01
00000 00/00/00 End 0.0
</pre>

In order to process this data file you need to do the following:

1\) Read in the account number, date, transaction, and beginning balance
for an individual. The beginning balance is the unpaid portion from the
previous month

2\) Calculate the interest on the unpaid balance. The interest rate is a
yearly interest rate; however, the interest is calculated using a
monthly interest rate because bills are sent out monthly. If the
previous balance is \<= \$1,000, then the interest rate is 15%;
otherwise, the interest rate is 18.5%.

3\) Process each transaction one line at a time until either the
sentinel value of 00000 is read or a different account is read. Before
beginning to process the next individual, print out summary account
information as shown on the next page.

The solution to this problem could be done with a nested loop, but you
are to use a single loop in your solution. Nested loop solutions will
lose points.

Here is an example of the output after processing the above data file.

<pre>
*********************************

*********************************

Account: 12345
Previous Balance: $1500.00
Interest Rate: 18.50%

Date        Purchase                Amount
10/01/14    Interest                 23.12
10/01/14    McDonalds                10.75
10/05/14    Walmart                  50.65
            Final Balance          1584.53

Account: 54321
Previous Balance: $16.75
Interest Rate: 15.00%

Date        Purchase                Amount
10/01/14    Interest                  0.21
10/06/14    McMenamins               23.00
10/07/14    Payment                 -25.00
10/10/14    Comcast                 130.01
            Final Balance           144.97

</pre>

**Note**: Date starts in column 1, Purchase starts in column 13, and
Amount starts in column 37. The transaction name will not be longer than
18 characters.

**To complete this assignment you must submit the following:**

1.  **An electronic Solution of your program on GitHub**

    a.  You are to click on the Assign04 GitHub Assignment Link on
        Moodle to accept this assignment as we've done in lab. Once
        accepted, code up a complete solution to the above assignment
        specification. Your complete solution is to be pushed to GitHub
        no later than the date and time specified above for your
        specific section. I will only grade your solution from the
        proper location on GitHub.

    b.  Pay attention to the example output above. Your program's output
        must look **exactly** like the example output! The spacing and
        newlines in your output must match exactly.

    c.  Make sure that your program compiles and runs correctly with no
        errors and no warnings. If you get any errors, double check that
        you typed everything correctly. Be aware that C++ is
        case-sensitive.

2.  **An electronic copy of your program is to be placed on Moodle**

    a.  See Lab01 for producing a pdf of your complete program. Once you
        have produced the pdf of your program and named the pdf your
        **punetid**, drop the pdf in the Assign04 folder on Moodle.

    b.  The pdf must be in the drop folder on Moodle by the time and day
        specified above. Anything submitted after that will be
        considered late.

**IMPORTANT:** This is not a last minute assignment. There is a reason
you have 12 days to complete this assignment. If you start this
assignment the weekend before it's due, there is a high likelihood that
you will not finish. Remember also, the tutors are not going to write
your code. They will help with a specific issue in your program.

> **Good luck! And remember, if you have any problems, come and see
> straight away. ÔÅä**
